# Temístocles academics projects 
 My name is Temístocles Neto, and this repository is a space to store and showcase a bit of my progress in the programming field.

I am originally from Paraíba, Brazil. I have already completed my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the Federal University of Campina Grande, and currently, I am in my first year of the Bachelor's degree program in Information Systems at UNIFACISA.
